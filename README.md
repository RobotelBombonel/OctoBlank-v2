# OctoBlank v2.0

OctoBlank is a chatbot AI developed in Python using the GPT4All library. It features a persistent memory system that can be fully customized and managed by the user. The AI operates via a sleek Pygame interface that provides a simple, modern user experience. Remember that the AI can do mistakes sometimes.

## Features
- **Memory System**: 
  - Save memory in a JSON file (`dtb.json`).
  - Use `/dmem` to delete all stored memory.
  - Use `/save` to store memory, e.g. `/save and what you want the AI to remember`
- **Pygame Interface**: 
  - Chat design with a text input field and a "Send" button.
  - Interaction for sending messages and viewing responses.
- **AI Details**:
  - AI Name: **OctoBlank**
  - Version: **v2.0**
  - Built with Python and JSON-based memory storage.

## How to install?
1. Install the files and put them into a folder
2. Install the python requirements that are in the requirements.txt file
3. Open main.py file in VS Code and run the file

## Details
- The dtb.json file doesn't affect the AI responses that bad anymore.
- After you pressed the button `Send` it will take a few moments for the AI to answer.
- This project was done using DeepSeek and ChatGPT (ChatGPT did the icon app - if you wanna convert the project into an app you will also have the app icon; Deepseek did the main functionalities).
